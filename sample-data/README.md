# sample data
The data files in this directory are taken from actual track runs, exported through the sampler's normal interfaces.

For AiM CSV files, that means that the session was downloaded to RaceStudio 3 and then a "Batch Convert" was run 
on it in order to produce the CSV. For TrackAddict format files, the CSV file was simply copied from the sampling
device (usually a smartphone of some kind).
