Python Race Data Analyzer

I've been doing HPDE (High Performance Driver Education) events since late 2020, and I'm now starting to truly 
realize how important data analysis is for getting better. I'm not the first to realize this, not by a long shot. 
I'm also not the first to develop a data visualization / data analysis tool. I currently make use of the Garmin 
Catalyst and of RaceStudio 3's analysis features, working on data from an AiM SOLO 2 DL device.

This project is my way of really getting familiar with the data available, with the interrelationships, and 
with using that data to make myself better. If you're in the same situation, I welcome all suggestions, bug 
reports, RFEs, patches, and anything else.
